

Info:
 - The OSEK OS test do follow the MODISTARC test plan, but not the test procedure.
 - The MIDSTARC test-suites are from 1999? while latest OSEK OS spec is from 2005?, so
   not all tests are applicable to the latest specification. 
 - Do not care about OSEK conformance classes, uses only top class ECC2
 - Tests for Autosar SC1, only   

Known to missing from tests:
 - Multiple alarms to one counter.
 - OSEK requirements that are "fixed" by Autosar, e.g. OS239,OS070,OS069,OS032,? 
 - Testing of "Use Parameter Access", etc.
 - Internal resoures (grouping of tasks)
 - SetEvent on suspended task from Alarm
  
Need conversion:
 - Scheduletables..
 - Autostart testing..
