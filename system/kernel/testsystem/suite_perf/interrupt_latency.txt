
A part of this test-suite measures interrupt latency.
Interrupt latency is the time it takes from the assertion of the interrupt
until the ISR starts to execute it first instruction.

The interrupt have dependencies to:
- Length of the critical sections.
- How hot the cache is.

The measuring technique used here is just to periodically run a routine on a 
HW-timer and measure the time from assertion to the first instruction. 
By raising/lowering the priority of the interrupt times for each interrupt 
priority could be calculated. If the system is more or less driven by a timer, 
the HW-timer should NOT be a multiple of the driving timer. 

Measure the time in an:
- idle system:  Will give you the execution time for the interrupt implementaion.  
- timer driven: TODO:
- 100% load:    If a test-system that uses all the OS funcionallity can be 
                constructed and it takes 100% of the CPU, running the HW-timer 
                long enough would give the worst possible interrupt latency 
                without interrupts.
